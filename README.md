# Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that facilitate direct communication between the brain and external devices. They translate neural signals into commands, enabling various applications such as neuroprosthetics, rehabilitation, and communication for individuals with disabilities.

## Electrode Types

Electrodes are essential components of BCIs, as they detect electrical activity from neurons. There are two main types of electrodes:

### 1. Invasive Electrodes
- *Description*: Implanted directly into the brain tissue.
- *Advantages*: 
  - High resolution and signal quality.
  - Ability to capture localized brain activity.
- *Disadvantages*: 
  - Surgical risks.
  - Potential for scarring and tissue response.

### 2. Non-Invasive Electrodes
- *Description*: Placed on the scalp, commonly using techniques like Electroencephalography (EEG).
- *Advantages*: 
  - Safe and easy to apply.
  - No surgical intervention required.
- *Disadvantages*: 
  - Lower resolution.
  - More susceptible to noise and interference.

## Conclusion

BCIs represent a promising frontier in neuroscience and technology, offering transformative potential for enhancing human capabilities and aiding those with disabilities.
